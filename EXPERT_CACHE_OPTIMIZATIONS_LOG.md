## Optimization Vectors

1. **Vector 1: Zero-Copy Slot Pool Execution (`MUL_MAT_ID` Direct Indexing)**
   - Eliminate in-band GPU-to-GPU (`cache_tensor` -> `input_cpy`) copies on cache hits.
   - Remap router IDs directly to slot indices and pass `slot_pool->tensor` to `MUL_MAT_ID`.

2. **Vector 2: Elimination of In-Band Router Synchronization**
   - Replace blocking `ggml_backend_synchronize(ids_backend)` with event-based synchronization and mapped/pinned router output memory.

3. **Vector 3: High-Throughput Pinned Host DMA Staging**
   - Stage miss transfers through 512-byte aligned pinned staging buffer for true concurrent PCIe DMA transfer (14-16 GB/s).

4. **Vector 4: Dual-Stream Asynchronous Speculative Prefetching**
   - Connect Markov transition predictor to background DMA transfer stream to prefetch layer L+1 experts while layer L computes.

5. **Vector 5: Atomic Layer Expert Bundling (`{gate, up, down}`)**
   - Ensure `{W_gate, W_up, W_down}` are admitted and evicted as an atomic unit, avoiding partial residency penalties.

6. **Vector 6: Prefill vs. Decode Adaptive Mode Switching**
   - Bypass cache eviction during multi-token prefill (`n_tokens > 1`) to eliminate cache thrashing.

7. **Vector 7: JIT Incremental Staged Rebalancing**
   - Distribute periodic rebalance promotions across layers just-in-time to eliminate single-token latency spikes (jank).

## Detailed Optimization Summary

### 1. Vector 1: Zero-Copy Slot Pool Execution
- **Mechanism**: Instead of allocating a flat cache and copying weight slices via D2D async copies into `input_cpy` for every hit on every token (~1,536 D2D copies per token), slot pool tensors (`[ne0, ne1, max_slots]`) are sub-allocated proportionally from `cache->tensor->data`. Router IDs are mapped directly to active slot indices in `ids_tensor`, and `node->src[0]` points directly to the resident slot pool tensor.
- **Impact**: Increased token generation from **25.12 tok/s $\to$ 27.25 tok/s (+8.5%)**.

### 2. Vector 6: Prefill vs. Decode Adaptive Mode Switching
- **Mechanism**: Detects multi-token prompt evaluation (`ids_tensor->ne[1] > 1`) and bypasses slot allocation / eviction, falling back to contiguous bulk transfers. Only activates zero-copy slot management during single-token generation (`ids_tensor->ne[1] == 1`).
- **Impact**: Restored and boosted prompt processing throughput from **10.04 tok/s $\to$ 481.27 tok/s (+2.7% over baseline)** while preserving zero-copy token generation.

### 3. Vector 3: Per-Slot Isolated Pinned Host DMA Staging
- **Mechanism**: Allocates a 16-slot, 512-byte aligned page-locked staging buffer on the host. When a cache miss occurs during decode, the CPU copies the slice into the corresponding staging slot at RAM memory bus bandwidth (~40-60 GB/s), allowing PCIe DMA transfers to proceed concurrently without blocking the host thread or colliding with concurrent in-flight transfers.

### 4. Vector 5: Atomic Expert Bundling
- **Mechanism**: Automatically registers `{gate, up, down}` weight tensors for every layer during context initialization (`ggml_backend_sched_register_expert_bundle`). Tracks expert co-residency so all three projections of an expert are managed as a cohesive unit.

### 5. Vector 7: JIT Incremental Staged Rebalancing
- **Mechanism**: Intercepts periodic rebalancing promotions and distributes the physical weight transfers smoothly across layers just before each layer executes via `ggml_backend_expert_cache_process_jit_swaps`, eliminating periodic frame drops or latency spikes.

## Expert Cache V2 Architecture & Multi-Run Benchmarks (-r 10)

### V2 Optimizations Implemented:
1. **Component 0: Fine-Grained Diagnostic Telemetry**: Added exact counters for CPU ID remaps, GPU ID resolutions, staging memcpy bytes, direct registered-host DMA bytes, slot map updates, and DMA wait time.
2. **Component 1: Per-Pool GPU-Resident Slot Resolution (`d_expert_to_slot`)**: Attached device mapping tensors directly to each slot pool with CPU shadow tables and batched dirty flushes, eliminating chatty per-mutation host-to-device transfers.
3. **Component 2: Bounded Direct Registered-Host DMA (`cudaHostRegister`)**: Registered CPU-offloaded MoE weight tensors into page-locked memory (with 1 GiB safety cap), eliminating the intermediate CPU `memcpy` into staging slots on misses.
4. **Component 3: Empirical Global Value-per-Byte Rebalancing**: Replaced static layer allocation formulas with global dynamic competition based on measured $\text{value} = \frac{\text{hits} \times \text{size}}{\text{alloc\_size}}$.

### Multi-Run Benchmark Results (`-r 10`, `p=512, n=64,256,512`):

| **Cold Decode (`tg64`)** | 25.61 ± 0.67 tok/s | **26.38 ± 0.36 tok/s** | **+3.0% speedup** | **Standard deviation cut in half (-46% jitter)** |

## Dynamic MTP Offload Correctness Fixes (2026-08-20)

**Scope**: The expert cache interacts with MTP (Multi-Token Prediction) drafting. Dynamic MTP offload loads the MTP block on host, then promotes it to a contiguous GPU buffer before the first draft decode. The following correctness defects were confirmed and fixed:

1. **Quantized padding was not zero-initialized**. `mtp_promote_to_gpu()` re-pointed each tensor at the GPU allocation and copied `ggml_nbytes()` bytes, but never called `ggml_backend_buffer_init_tensor()`. CUDA's `init_tensor` memsets the padding tail of quantized weights (`padded_size - original_size` bytes); without it, `MUL_MAT_ID` could read uninitialized memory when a full padded slot was consumed.
   - **Fix**: `ggml_backend_buffer_init_tensor()` is called per tensor after `data`/`buffer` re-pointing and before the async copy. A failed init restores every touched tensor to its captured `host_data`/`host_buffer`, syncs/frees the temp backend, and pins `promotion_failed`.
2. **MTP experts were registered as host-resident in the expert cache**. `llama_context::sched_reserve` registered all model layers including the MTP block. After promotion, those weights no longer live in host memory, so the cache held stale host pointers.
   - **Fix**: The registration loop skips dynamically promoted MTP layers (`model.has_mtp() && il >= model.hparams.n_layer()`). Static MTP models are unaffected.
3. **Dynamic collection accepted view tensors and non-host overrides**. Relocating a view or a non-host tensor independently would corrupt the shared buffer.
   - **Fix**: Collection is all-or-nothing: every MTP tensor must be an owned host tensor (`t->view_src == NULL && ggml_backend_buffer_is_host(t->buffer)`), else the mode is disabled with a `LOG_WARN` and host-resident MTP fallback is preserved.
4. **`--fit` did not account for the deferred promotion buffer**. The dynamic MTP collection ran after the `ml.no_alloc` early return, so fit never saw the MTP GPU allocation and could overcommit VRAM.
   - **Fix**: A sizing pass runs before the no-allocation early return. `llama_model_mtp_dynamic_gpu_size()` returns the deferred buffer size (0 when disabled), and `common/fit.cpp` charges it to the first GPU device (`deferred MTP promotion buffer = <MiB>`).
5. **Failed promotion retried allocation and repeated error spam**. A transient VRAM shortage caused a new `buf_gpu` allocation and error log on every draft step.
   - **Fix**: A sticky `promotion_failed` flag is set on buffer-alloc, backend-init, or tensor-init failure; future promotions return `false` without retrying.

### Deterministic Validation Matrix (2026-08-20)

Model: `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-APEX-MTP-Quality.gguf` (21.87 GB, one MTP block `blk.40`, 20 MTP tensors, 856.36 MiB). Fixed prompt, `temperature = 0`, `top-k = 1`, `seed = 42`, fresh server per row, `parallel = 1` (row F = 2).

| Row | Spec | `exc` | `mtp-dynamic-offload` | draft_n / accepted | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | none | 0 | off | 0 / 0 | coherent, reproducible |
| B | none | 64M | off | 0 / 0 | token-identical to A (cache does not alter target-only output) |
| C | draft-mtp | 0 | off | 188 / 160 | coherent |
| D | draft-mtp | 0 | on | 182 / 164 | coherent, promotion logs confirmed |
| E | draft-mtp | 64M | on | 186 / 161 | coherent |
| F | draft-mtp (parallel=2) | 0 | on | 194 / 157 | both slots coherent |

Confirmed with `-lv 4` (model-load `LLAMA_LOG_INFO` is filtered at default verbosity 3):

```text
load_tensors: MTP dynamic offload enabled: 20 MTP tensors (856.36 MiB) staged in host memory
mtp_promote_to_gpu: MTP weights promoted to GPU in 101.42 ms (856.36 MiB)
common_get_device_memory_data_impl: deferred MTP promotion buffer = 856.36 MiB on CUDA0
slot print_timing: draft acceptance = 0.95238 (20 accepted / 21 generated), mean len = 2.82
```

**Verdict**: No row reproduced gibberish. All draft-mtp rows produced high acceptance (~85%) with coherent output. The dynamic-MTP correctness fixes are verified in `380f9af17`.
